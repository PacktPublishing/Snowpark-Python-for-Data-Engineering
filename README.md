## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter04.

The code will look like the following:
```
current_runs = dag_op.get_current_dag_runs(dag)
for r in current_runs:
    print(f"RunId={r.run_id} State={r.state}")
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for data engineers, data scientists, developers, and data practitioners seeking an in-depth understanding of Snowpark’s features and best practices for deploying various workloads in Snowpark using the Python programming language.
